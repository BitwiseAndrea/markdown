<p>Some text</p>
<p><span class="badge note"><span class="badge-title">Note</span></span> </p>
<p>More text and stuff.</p>
<p><span class="badge note"><span class="badge-title">Did you know?</span></span> You can customize the title of the badge</p>
<p><span class="badge mycustomcssclass"><span class="badge-title">And now...</span></span> For something completely different.
You can also use a custom CSS class name.</p>
<p><span class="badge class1 class2 class3"><span class="badge-title">And now...</span></span> For something completely different.
Several class names can be separated by space chars.</p>
<p><span class="badge note anotherclass"><span class="badge-title">Note</span></span>
The default title is the capitalized first class name.</p>
<p><span class="badge tip"></span>
An explicitly empty string prevents the title from being rendered.</p>
<p>Using one in the middle of a sentence <span class="badge like this"><span class="badge-title">Like</span></span> is totally fine!</p>
<p>Extra whitespace after the title should not alter output:</p>
<p><span class="badge note"><span class="badge-title">Note</span></span></p>+ </span>
