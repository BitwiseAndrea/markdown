<p>Some text</p>
<p>
<span class="badge note">
<span class="badge-title">Note</span>
</span>
</p>
<p>More text and stuff.</p>
<span class="badge note">
<span class="badge-title">Did you know?</span>
</span> You can customize the title of the badge
<span class="badge mycustomcssclass">
<span class="badge-title">And now...</span>
</span> For something completely different.
<p>You can also use a custom CSS class name.</p>
<span class="badge class1 class2 class3">
<span class="badge-title">And now...</span>
</span> For something completely different.
<p>Several class names can be separated by space chars.</p>
<span class="badge note anotherclass">
<span class="badge-title">Note</span>
</span>
<p>The default title is the capitalized first class name.</p>
<span class="badge tip"></span>
<p>An explicitly empty string prevents the title from being rendered.</p>
<p>Using one in the middle of a sentence
<span class="badge note">
<span class="badge-title">like this</span>
</span> is totally fine!
</p>
<p>Extra whitespace after the title should not alter output:</p>
<span class="badge note">
<span class="badge-title">Note</span>
</span>
