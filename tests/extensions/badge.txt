Some text

{{ note }} 

More text and stuff.

{{ Note "Did you know?" }} You can customize the title of the badge

{{ mycustomcssclass "And now..." }} For something completely different.
You can also use a custom CSS class name.

{{ class1 class2    class3 "And now..." }} For something completely different.
Several class names can be separated by space chars.

{{ note anotherclass }}
The default title is the capitalized first class name.

{{ tip "" }}
An explicitly empty string prevents the title from being rendered.

Using one in the middle of a sentence {{ like this }} is totally fine!

Extra whitespace after the title should not alter output:

{{ note             }}
